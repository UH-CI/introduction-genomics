###Instructor's setup notes

By default SQLite Manager opens in a separate window and it is not possible to zoom in to enlarge the font
so that it is more readable, especially for students in the back rows.

The way to do fix this is to:  
1. Open the SQLite Manager  
2. Click on the *Settings* button,   
3. Chose *Start SQLite Manager in a new tab*.   
You can then use **Ctrl - +** to zoom just like any other web page.
